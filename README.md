# Transport_NEGF
A Python-based framework for transport calculations using the Non-Equilibrium Greenâ€™s Function (NEGF) method with Self-Consistent Field (SCF) convergence.
<br>
This repository provides a Python implementation of NEGF-based transport calculations with SCF convergence, designed for nanoscale electronic transport simulations. The code is structured to handle transport through small systems, such as gold linear electrodes, with an emphasis on self-consistent calculations to capture charge transfer effects. The framework is inspired by TranSiesta but optimized for lightweight systems
